At first glance, combined debounce and combined throttle look similar â€” both can:

Run immediately once.

Ensure another call at the end of the burst.

But thereâ€™s a subtle difference in intent and behavior:

ðŸ”¹ Debounce (combined)

Delays execution until no more events happen for the full delay.
If you keep typing/moving, the trailing call keeps getting pushed further.

Useful for:
Search input API calls (only run when user pauses).
Resizing a window (only react once user stops).


ðŸ”¹ Throttle (leading + trailing)

Guarantees execution at fixed intervals (like every delay ms).
While extra calls inside the delay are ignored, the last one in the window can still be scheduled.

Useful for:
Scroll events (smooth updates, but not too frequent).
Button clicks (prevent double-submits but still respond).
